    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>
      
I am an artist of many disciplines, but got my start in the east coast music scene in my touring bands Alarm Drum, and Mybrother Mysister (playing alongside bands such as Blueberry, Vivian K, Fk.mt, Melon In, Sick, Danger Boy, Joy Boy, Those Lavender Whales, GT, Junior Astronomers, among many others which I can recall for you.) I am interested, while existing in today’s vastly deprecating social system, in the way transdisciplinary art can break down the spacial and temporal barriers which hold us apart and keep us from experiencing the love we all truly hold. In my time at Brooklyn College, I explored the interdisciplinary PIMA program, the sound art- Sonic Arts- program, as well as participated in a federal work study position which allowed me to construct my ideas as physical in its purest sense (plastic; metal.) My future goals for my art work and music are to create sonic systems which generate a (sonic) live painting of situational awareness between bodies, and to some extent reach beyond traditional language which is constantly being modulated and modified by the deep learning algorithms permeating our world. Finally, I am a biological artist who plants beets, and have modified my body with 4 body modifications, which were historically a permeation of xenoestrogens. As the world deconstructs everything we do, and assassinates our soulful connection to the body with endless systematic tendrils of world governance (like chthulu,) artists are a dying light whom remain in the cavernous depths of humanity’s historical existence. We must harness the little flame that we do have and extend ourselves into the earth again, as we were meant to cavernously inhabit. I am very close to completion of my B.S. degree in Investigations into Music and Performance, and I aim high to continue my performative journey in this cathartic world of wave and vibrational energies.
